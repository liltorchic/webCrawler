Libraries Approach: we did not need to use a lot of libraries for this project. We used the libraries from the template and we added the curl library. We had no experience with library before but we learned it from the internet. This library helped us extract URL links from html content of websites. 
Variables: We had to declare some global variables to track the number of URLs we have and match and check it with the limit inputted when running the program. 
Structures: we kept the structres declared from the template the same. 
Functions: We did not change anything in the initialization of the queue function (initQueue).
